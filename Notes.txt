FastAPI is a web framework which is used to make restful API's
API is application programming interface.

Restapi uses the HTTP request methods like (get, post put, patch, delete) to handle CRUD operations.

To create a new environment we type python -m venv nameOfEnvironment.

If we provide the link followed by openapi.json then that will give us a detailed json of all the api. 

we can also use swagger UI to do this in a more efficient way. 
If we provide the link followed by docs then we can reach swagger.

Path parameters: Basically the concept of dynamic routing where we can take the extra parameters in curly braces.
Path parameters routes should always be below the path routes. 

Query parameters are a set of key value pairs that go after question marks within an api url
skip_book: str = "book_3" so here the default value is book_3
if we write skip_book: str then default value is none
if we write skip_book: Optional[str]

POST requests

POST is generally used to send a request body to the server and send the response back.

UUID - Universal universal Identifier- 128 bit label used for information in computer systems

We can use the Pydantic Fields to perform extra data validation in the Pydantic Models. 

HTML form tags send form fields and that data is encoded in media type and fastapi will automatically decode the forms for us.
